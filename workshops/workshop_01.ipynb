    "These workshops come to accompany the lectures and recitations by taking another dive into the subjects of this course, but from a more \"hands-on\" approach. The purpose of the workshops is to achieve the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The primary goal**: Improve the understanding and intuition behind the methods taught in the course by applying them to examples, and discussing the different nuances of each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The secondary goal**: Provide tools for approaching and solving machine learning real problems in real life by using state of the art tools to problem sets which are based on real data."

    "### A comment about the code\n",
    "In many cases, the code and algorithms in these workshops are written in a very inefficient way. We have preferred to keep the code readable and as close as possible to the algorithm described in class. In almost all cases, there already exist packages implementing these algorithms efficiently and robustly, when possible we have tried to give references to these implementations."

From basic mathematical tools([basic numeric](http://www.numpy.org/), [advance numerics](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [symbolic math](https://www.sympy.org) [data handling](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [visualizing](https://mode.com/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries), etc.), through a range of advanced frameworks for [deep learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/python-deep-learning-frameworks-overview.html), [distributed computing](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing), [web servers](https://www.djangoproject.com/), etc. and up to stuff such as a complete framework for writing [simple games](https://www.pygame.org)\n",
