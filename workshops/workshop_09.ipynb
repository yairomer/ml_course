Like the biological networks, they are composed of a network of simple units, each performing a simple mathematical operation, which are connected together in order to model complex functions. These units are usually referred to as artificial neurons.\n",

Use of these frameworks makes working with deep neural networks much more simpler and efficient, mostly in terms of implementation. \n",

It was initially developed and is backed by Facebook. It is a slightly younger framework which is rapidly gaining popularity. Currently, it is almost as popular as Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) & [Caffe2](https://caffe2.ai/)**: Has support for C, c++, Python, and Matlab. Was developed at Berkeley and is currently maintained by Facebook. It is a relatively older framework and is quite popular although it seems as if it's popularity is decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Keras](https://keras.io/)**: A Python framework which is built in top of other frameworks, such as Tensorflow, and is intended to provide a more \"human-friendly\" interface. It operates at a higher level of abstraction and provides less control over the fine details of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)**: A recently released framework which is built around PyTorch and is designed to incorporate the common best practices into the library. The framework is receiving a lot of positive feedback and is starting gaining popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/getting-started-with-deep-learning-toolbox.html)**: Recently, Matlab has published a deep learning toolbox for working with deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we have decided to use PyTorch over Tensorflow, since it uses an intuitive NumPy-like interface, which makes it easier to get started with."

    "When working with long learning stages (in many cases people can even run the learning stage for a few days) the need to monitor the learning process arises. Mainly we would like to monitor how does the objective and the risk functions improve over time (on the train and the validation datasets), and some sampled results.\n",

    "One of the commonly used tools for this task is TensorFlow's built-in dashboard, which is called **[TensorBaord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)**. TensorBoard provides a simple way to writing arbitrary parameters to it, such as the train and test risk, and then arranges them in interactive graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While TensorBoard was originally designed to work specifically with TensorFlow, a package called **[tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX)** enables writing data to the TensorBorad dashboard from any python code.\n",
